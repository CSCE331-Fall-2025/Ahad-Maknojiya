    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Ahad Maknojiya, and I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science at <a href="https://www.tamug.edu/">Texas A&M University in Galveston</a>. My journey into computer science began out of curiosity about how technology works behind the scenes, but over time it has developed into a deep passion for problem solving, innovation, and lifelong learning.</p>
    <p>My academic and personal experiences have allowed me to gain exposure to different areas of computer science, particularly algorithms and Artificial Intelligence. I enjoy the logical structure of algorithms and how they can break down even the most complicated problems into manageable steps. Additionally, Artificial Intelligence fascinates me because of its power to reveal patterns and insights that drive decision making in almost every field today. Beyond the technical side, I am passionate about explaining concepts in a way that makes them accessible to everyone, whether they have a technical background or not. I find great satisfaction in taking something complex and reframing it so that others can understand and apply it.</p>
    <p>Another key part of my approach is creativity. I like looking at challenges from different angles and experimenting with unique solutions instead of sticking only to the most straightforward path. Staying up to date with new trends and emerging technologies is also something I make a priority, as I believe the best professionals are those who never stop learning.
    <p>Outside of academics, I strive for balance by enjoying a variety of hobbies. I love snowboarding, which combines my adventurous side with an appreciation for the outdoors. My favorite TV show is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/">Severance</a>, a series I admire for its originality and thought provoking ideas. In my free time, I also enjoy playing video games, with <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny">Destiny 2</a> being my favorite, as it allows me to relax while also engaging in strategic, team based play.</p>
